    "# Final Notebook: Yolo Detection of Bacteria on Agar\n",
    "###### Dietrich Nigh\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the discovery of bacteria in the 17th century, scientists have been trying to identify and classify those tiny specs under the microscope. In the 19th century, Julius Richard Petri, a German physician working under the famous Robert Koch, developed his namesake, the Petri dish, for this purpose. He needed to reliably grow bacteria without risk of containmination so he could accurately study his specimens. Since that time, the classification of bacteria has come a long way. Many bacterial samples can be sequenced to elucidate all of their secrets. That said, the Petri dish is still a critical tool in the culturing and classification of bacterial samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Presently, the identification of bacteria is a laborious and time consuming task. This is not to mention the years of training needed to properly perform the task. Even still mistakes can be made. To reduce the cost (both in time and money), recent years have seen an explosion of research into the construction machine learning models to correctly identify bacteria from a sample. Agar plates (Petri dishes with agar media) are a widely available, affordable, and effective means of growing isolated samples. If a model could be made to quickly and accurately differiante bacteria based on their growth, medical diagnostics could be done quickly with less training for technicians. For research applications, time spent memorizing such works as Bergey's Manual could be diverted elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model chosen for this task is YOLO. YOLO is a single stage object detection model from Ultralytics with many hidden layers. YOLO is a single stage detector, meaning it performs regression around the object of interest and the classification of said image in parallel. This makes it much faster than dual-stage detectors, like Faster RCNN, which perform these tasks sequentially. The model is also relatively lightweight once trained. The model was developed for such tasks as live object detection after all. With this model we were able to construct a highly precise model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this model is only good for 5 different species, I am hoping to gain the funding necessary to improve this model model. I am seeking this funding from NIH.\n",

    "#### Results\n",
    "My final YOLO model takes images as input and consists of __many__ hidden layers. The first layer is a convolutional layer that applies a set of filters to the input image to detect certain features in the image. The output is then passed to the next layer to detect more complicated features. This continues until the final output layer. YOLO utilizes parrellel processing of the image to classify objects as well as regress around the objects. This allows the model to be much faster than dual stage detectors such as faster RCNN. For those of you interested, here is [Ultralytic's github](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). \n",

    "During training, the model continues to refine the layers and adjust the weight of specific neurons until it can no longer improve itself. After 10 epochs of no improvement, the model will stop itself and save the model at whichever epoch had the highest score. My model precede to run for 87 epochs before leveling out and stopping itself at 97 epochs. This model was then saved and utilized in the application deployment. \n",
